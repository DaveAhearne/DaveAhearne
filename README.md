## 👋 David A’Hearne

Senior software engineer and engineering leader with 13+ years of experience building, operating, and scaling production systems across fintech, energy, defence, and SaaS. Extensive experience owning complex systems end to end, leading engineering teams, and delivering business-critical software in regulated and high-availability environments.

I finished my role at Bright in December 2024 to focus on strengthening my foundations in mathematics and data science. I am currently studying for a BSc in Mathematics with the Open University and completing the Cambridge Data Science Career Accelerator programme.

## 🛠️ Core Engineering Experience

My primary background is in senior and lead engineering roles, with long-term ownership of production systems:

- Design and evolution of distributed systems and microservice architectures  
- Cloud-native development on Azure and AWS, including infrastructure automation and CI/CD pipelines  
- Strong emphasis on reliability through TDD and BDD, including unit, integration, contract, and end-to-end testing  
- Refactoring legacy systems, managing technical debt, and improving observability through logging, metrics, and alerting  
- Hands-on experience with C#, .NET, SQL, JavaScript and TypeScript, React, and service-oriented architectures  

I have consistently worked on systems under real operational pressure, balancing delivery speed with correctness, performance, and maintainability.

## 👥 Leadership and Management

Alongside hands-on technical work, I have held senior leadership and management responsibilities including:

- Hiring, onboarding, and managing engineering teams of up to 15+ mixed-discipline members  
- Defining technical direction, architecture, and development standards  
- Owning delivery from ideation and prioritisation through to live operation and support  
- Mentoring engineers through structured one-to-ones, pairing, code review, and development plans  
- Working closely with product, customer experience, marketing, and stakeholders to align technical delivery with business outcomes  
- Leading incident response, post-mortems, and continuous improvement initiatives  

My leadership approach is pragmatic and delivery-focused, with an emphasis on clarity, sustainable pace, and building teams that can ship high-quality software consistently.

## 🧠 Data Science and Machine Learning

Alongside my core engineering work, I am developing deeper capability in data science and machine learning, with a strong emphasis on fundamentals and real-world applicability.

Recent applied work includes:

- Exploratory data analysis using statistical measures, distribution analysis, skew, and outlier detection  
- Feature engineering from raw transactional, temporal, and behavioural data  
- Unsupervised learning including IQR-based detection, One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, and K-Means clustering  
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE for analysis and validation  
- Supervised learning with neural networks and XGBoost, including handling class imbalance and staged feature availability  
- Structured model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning using precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and AUC  

My interest lies in how these techniques translate into reliable, maintainable systems rather than isolated notebook results.


## 🔧 Current Technical Exploration

I am actively exploring architectures that combine:

- Go for performance, concurrency, and simplicity  
- HTMX for minimal, server-driven interfaces  
- Modern NLP and ML techniques for low-latency, cost-efficient systems  

The focus is on building lean ML-enabled products that avoid unnecessary infrastructure complexity or vendor lock-in.
